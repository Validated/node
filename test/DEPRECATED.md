# Deprecated!

This directory is depreated.

New tests go in `/tests` (plural), and must be written in RITEway, not Alsatian.

Also: most of the tests in this `Integration` directory are actually functional tests, not integration.

If you find yourself spending too much time updating an Alsatian test, consider migrating it to RITEway.
